# ✅ Day 2 Complete: Song Upload & Storage System

## 🎯 Objective

Build a complete song upload system with file handling, cloud storage, and a beautiful UI for uploading songs with metadata.

---

## 📦 What Was Built

### Backend Components

#### 1. **Cloudinary Integration** (`backend/src/utils/cloudinary.utils.js`)

- `uploadAudioToCloudinary()` - Upload audio files to cloud storage
- `uploadImageToCloudinary()` - Upload cover images with optimization
- `deleteFromCloudinary()` - Delete files from cloud
- `isCloudinaryConfigured()` - Check if Cloudinary credentials are set
- **Features:**
  - Automatic MP3 conversion with 128k bitrate
  - Image resizing (800x800px) and optimization
  - Automatic local file cleanup after upload
  - Error handling with file cleanup on failure

#### 2. **Upload Controller** (`backend/src/controllers/upload.controller.js`)

- **`POST /api/upload/song`** - Upload song with audio + optional cover
  - Validates required fields (title, artist, duration)
  - Supports Cloudinary or local storage (fallback)
  - Parses tags from JSON or comma-separated string
  - Creates Song document with all metadata
  - Returns populated song object with user info
- **`POST /api/upload/avatar`** - Upload user avatar
  - Validates image file
  - Uploads to Cloudinary (dhvny/avatars folder)
  - Updates user profile

#### 3. **Song Controller** (`backend/src/controllers/song.controller.js`)

- **`GET /api/songs`** - List all songs with pagination
  - Search by text (`search` param)
  - Filter by genre, uploader, isLegend
  - Sort options (default: newest first)
  - Returns liked status for authenticated users
- **`GET /api/songs/:id`** - Get single song
- **`GET /api/songs/user/:userId`** - Get songs by specific user
- **`PATCH /api/songs/:id`** - Update song metadata (uploader only)
- **`DELETE /api/songs/:id`** - Delete song (uploader only)
- **`POST /api/songs/:id/play`** - Increment play count

#### 4. **Routes**

- **Upload Routes** (`backend/src/routes/upload.routes.js`)

  - Uses Multer middleware for multipart/form-data
  - Protected endpoints (requires authentication)
  - Supports multiple files (audio + cover)

- **Song Routes** (`backend/src/routes/song.routes.js`)
  - Public endpoints with `optionalAuth` (returns liked status if logged in)
  - Private endpoints for update/delete

### Frontend Components

#### 1. **Upload API** (`frontend/src/api/upload.api.js`)

- `uploadSong(songData, audioFile, coverFile, onProgress)`
  - Builds FormData with files and metadata
  - Tracks upload progress
  - Returns uploaded song object
- `uploadAvatar(avatarFile, onProgress)`
  - Uploads user avatar with progress tracking

#### 2. **Upload Page** (`frontend/src/pages/UploadPage.jsx`)

A modern, feature-rich upload interface with:

**Features:**

- 🖱️ **Drag & Drop** - Drop audio files directly
- 🎵 **Audio Preview** - Automatic duration detection
- 🖼️ **Cover Upload** - Image preview with crop
- 📝 **Metadata Form** - Title, artist, album, genre, tags, lyrics
- 📊 **Progress Bar** - Real-time upload progress
- ✅ **Validation** - File size, type, required fields
- 🎨 **Modern UI** - Glassmorphism design, gradients, animations
- 📱 **Responsive** - Mobile-friendly layout

**Form Fields:**

- Title\* (required)
- Artist\* (required)
- Album (optional)
- Genre (dropdown with 15+ genres)
- Tags (comma-separated)
- Lyrics (textarea)

**File Handling:**

- Audio: MP3, WAV, M4A - Max 50MB
- Cover: PNG, JPG, WebP - Max 5MB
- Automatic duration extraction from audio file
- Preview before upload

## 🔧 Configuration

### Cloudinary Setup (Optional)

If you want to use cloud storage instead of local files, add to `.env`:

```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

**Fallback:** If Cloudinary is not configured, files are stored locally in `backend/uploads/`.

### File Size Limits

In `backend/.env`:

```env
MAX_AUDIO_SIZE=52428800  # 50MB
MAX_IMAGE_SIZE=5242880   # 5MB
```

## 🧪 Testing the Upload System

### 1. Start Backend (Already Running ✅)

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

Server runs on: http://localhost:4000

### 2. Start Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs on: http://localhost:5175

### 3. Test Upload Flow

1. **Navigate to Upload Page**

   - Click "Upload" from home or bottom nav
   - URL: http://localhost:5175/upload

2. **Upload a Song**

   - Drag an audio file or click "Choose File"
   - Fill in required fields (Title, Artist)
   - Optionally add cover image, album, genre, tags, lyrics
   - Click "Upload Song"
   - Progress bar shows upload status
   - Redirects to My Songs on success

3. **Verify Upload**
   - Check My Songs page for new song
   - Song should appear with all metadata
   - Click play button to test playback

### 4. API Testing with curl

**Upload Song:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/upload/song \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "audio=@path/to/song.mp3" \
  -F "cover=@path/to/cover.jpg" \
  -F "title=Test Song" \
  -F "artist=Test Artist" \
  -F "duration=180" \
  -F "tags=[\"pop\",\"2024\"]"
```

**Get All Songs:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/api/songs
```

**Get Song by ID:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/api/songs/{SONG_ID}
```

## 🐛 Known Issues / Limitations

1. **No Processing Queue** - Large files block upload (future: use job queue)
2. **No Duplicate Detection** - Same song can be uploaded multiple times
3. **No Audio Validation** - Doesn't check if audio is actually playable
4. **No Waveform Generation** - Future feature for visualization
5. **No Batch Upload** - Only one song at a time

---

## 🎉 Success Criteria Met

- ✅ Backend upload endpoint working
- ✅ File validation and error handling
- ✅ Cloud storage integration
- ✅ Modern, intuitive upload UI
- ✅ Progress feedback for users
- ✅ Song metadata management

4. **Test validation** - Missing title/artist should show errors
5. **Test drag & drop** - Should work on desktop
6. **Test mobile** - Responsive layout on small screens
7. **Test playback** - Uploaded song should play in player

---

## 📝 Code Quality

- ✅ Error handling in all endpoints
- ✅ File cleanup on errors
- ✅ Input validation
- ✅ Type checking
- ✅ Progress callbacks
