# 🎵 Dhvny - Day 1 Complete! ✅

## What We Built Today

### Backend (✅ Complete)

- ✅ Express server with MongoDB
- ✅ User model with password hashing
- ✅ JWT authentication (login/register/me)
- ✅ Auth middleware (protect routes)
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Rate limiting
- ✅ File upload setup (for Day 2)
- ✅ All database models (ready for future days)

### Frontend Integration (Ready to Test)

- ✅ .env configured to point to backend
- ✅ Auth API already compatible
- ✅ AuthContext ready to use real API

## 🚀 Let's Test It!

### Step 1: Start MongoDB

```powershell
# If you have MongoDB installed locally:
mongod

# Or use MongoDB Atlas (free cloud):
# 1. Go to https://mongodb.com/cloud/atlas
# 2. Create free cluster
# 3. Get connection string
# 4. Update MONGODB_URI in backend/.env
```

### Step 2: Start Backend

```powershell
# Open NEW terminal
cd C:\Dhvny\backend

# Install dependencies (first time only)
npm install

# Start server
npm run dev
```

You should see:

```
✅ Connected to MongoDB
🚀 Server running on http://localhost:4000
📡 Socket.IO ready for real-time connections
```

### Step 3: Start Frontend

```powershell
# Open ANOTHER new terminal
cd C:\Dhvny\frontend

# Start frontend
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Test Authentication

1. **Open browser:** http://localhost:5174/auth/login
2. **Register new user:**

   - Go to register page
   - Create account (username, email, password)
   - Should automatically log you in!

3. **Check console:**

   - Backend terminal: See "POST /api/auth/register" logs
   - Frontend: Should show user data in React DevTools

4. **Test logout and login:**
   - Logout
   - Login with same credentials
   - Should work!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to MongoDB"

**Fix:** Make sure MongoDB is running!

```powershell
# Windows - check if MongoDB service is running:
net start MongoDB

# Or use MongoDB Atlas (easier!)
# Get connection string and update backend/.env:
# MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/dhvny
```

### "Port 4000 already in use"

**Fix:** Kill the process or change port

```powershell
# Find process using port 4000
netstat -ano | findstr :4000

# Kill it (replace PID with actual number)
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Or change port in backend/.env:
# PORT=5000
```

### "CORS error" in browser

**Fix:** Make sure backend is running and CORS_ORIGIN is correct

```env
# In backend/.env:
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5174
```

### "JWT_SECRET not defined"

**Fix:** Check backend/.env file exists and has JWT_SECRET

```env
JWT_SECRET=dhvny-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-for-production-2024
```

## 📊 What You Can Test Now

### ✅ Working Features:

1. **Register** - Create new user accounts
2. **Login** - Sign in with email/password
3. **Logout** - Clear session
4. **Get current user** - Auto-restore session on refresh
5. **Protected routes** - Try accessing pages when logged out

### ❌ Not Working Yet (Coming in Next Days):

- Song upload (Day 2)
- Playing uploaded songs (Day 3)
- Comments (Day 5)
- Friends (Day 6)
- Playlists (Day 7)
- Real-time features (Day 8-9)

## 🎓 What You Learned Today

1. **Backend Setup:** Express + MongoDB + Mongoose
2. **Authentication:** JWT tokens, password hashing (bcrypt)
3. **Security:** Rate limiting, CORS, Helmet headers
4. **Models:** Mongoose schemas with validation
5. **Middleware:** Auth protection, error handling
6. **API Design:** RESTful endpoints, response normalization
7. **Environment Config:** dotenv for secrets

## 📝 Tomorrow (Day 2): Song Upload

We'll build:

- Multer file upload endpoint
- Audio file storage (local or Cloudinary)
- Song creation API
- Upload form in frontend
- Progress tracking

Get some rest! 🌙

## 🤔 Questions to Think About

1. Where should we store song files? (Local vs Cloud)
2. What audio formats should we support? (MP3, WAV, etc.)
3. Should we validate audio files? (Check duration, bitrate)
4. Do we want to extract metadata? (Artist, album from ID3 tags)

**See you tomorrow for Day 2!** 🚀

## 🆘 Need Help?

If something isn't working:

1. Check both terminals (frontend + backend) for errors
2. Check browser console (F12) for errors
3. Make sure MongoDB is running
4. Make sure both servers started successfully
5. Check .env files are configured correctly

**Backend Health Check:**
Open in browser: http://localhost:4000/health

Should show:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2024-...",
  "uptime": 123
}
```
